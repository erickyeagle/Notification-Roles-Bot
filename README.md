# Notification Roles Bot
Notification Roles Bot is a Discord bot that simplifies the use of what we coined as "notification roles". A notification role is a standard, mentionable Discord role that lacks all permissions. These roles can be made for things such as games, etc. Any user that wants to be subscribed to a role ping can have the role added to themselves.
